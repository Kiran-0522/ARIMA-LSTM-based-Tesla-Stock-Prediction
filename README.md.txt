## 📌 Project Overview

This project combines classical time series modeling (ARIMA) with deep learning (LSTM) to forecast Tesla stock prices.  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using historical stock data from 2020 to 2025.

## 🛠️ How to Use

### Notebook:
- Open `ARIMA & LSTM based Tesla Stock Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
- Run cells sequentially to load data, visualize trends, and train models.

### App Interface (Optional):
- Run `Time_Series_deployment.py` using:
  ```bash
  streamlit run Time_Series_deployment.py


- View predictions and charts interactively.

📊 Features
- ARIMA model for short-term trend capture
- LSTM model for long-term pattern learning
- Combined forecast visualization
- Dataset: tesla_2020_2025.csv
- Optional Streamlit app for deployment

📦 Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, keras, tensorflow, streamlit

🚀 Stretch Goals (Optional)
- Deploy app on Hugging Face or Render
- Add model explainability (e.g., SHAP for LSTM)
- Integrate live stock data stream via API

🧠 Reflection
This project helped me understand hybrid time series modeling and the strengths of combining statistical and neural approaches.
I explored ARIMA for trend fitting and LSTM for sequence learning.
All files are organized for easy review and reuse.

🔗 Google Colab Compatibility
The notebook is compatible with Google Colab.
You may need to upload tesla_2020_2025.csv manually.
